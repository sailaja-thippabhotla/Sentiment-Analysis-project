Here as i told, with sentiment analysis, the system shall be able to judge the statements, whether the statement is being positive or negitive or neutral.
In turn we understand whether its a happy or a sad statement basically!
Lets do the coding with the help of R in this project.
The dataset we use in this project is provided by the R package which is, janeaustenR.
Lets understand what's exactly tidy data principle is:
Using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks easier, more effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use.
Much of the infrastructure needed for text mining with tidy data frames already exists in packages like dplyr, broom, tidyr and ggplot2.
In this package, we provide functions and supporting data sets to allow conversion of text to and from tidy formats,
and to switch seamlessly between tidy tools and existing text mining packages.
In order to build our project on sentiment analysis, we will make use of the tidytext package 
that comprises of sentiment lexicons that are present in the dataset of ‘sentiments’.
