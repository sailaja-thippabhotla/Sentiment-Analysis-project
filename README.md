# Sentiment-Analysis-project
In this project we will create tiny text package and create words corresponding to the dataset.In this project we shall be able to categorize words, whether they are positive or negitive and as well we shall estimate the magnitude of the words.So basically in any article or a blog or a social media post, it is really essential to understand the polarity of words, by polarity i mean, whether the words are positive or negitive or neutral. With the help of sentiment analysis you can be able to differentiate it better and work on the sentiment of words in the statements.
